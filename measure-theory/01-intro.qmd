## What is Supervised Learning?

We are given training data $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$...

### Hypothesis Class

We define a hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ such that...

$$
h^* = \arg\min_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \mathcal{R}(h)
$$

## Goals

By the end of this lecture, you should understand:
- What supervised learning is
- The difference between training loss and true risk
